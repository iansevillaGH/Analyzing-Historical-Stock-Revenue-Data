# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data

In this project, we simulate working for a hedge fund and analyze historical stock and revenue data for two companies, Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). We'll be working with Python, Pandas, Beautiful Soup for our web scraping, and Plotly for data visualization.
